Domain Model Concept

Problem: Creating a loop in our domain model due to make-vehicle(one to many relationship) and model-vehicle(many to many relationship). However, Relational Database don't like loops

Make    (1) ------- (n) Model
              -      |
                -    |
Feature (n) ------- (n) Vehicle

Solution: Remove make-vehicle relationship because make can be inferred from model. Therefore, model-vehicle becomes one to many relationship due to model-make relationship

Make    (1) ------- (n) Model
                        (1)
                         |
                        (n)
Feature (n) ------- (n) Vehicle
