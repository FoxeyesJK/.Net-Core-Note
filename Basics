Dependency Injection

Dependency : Another object that class needs to function
Class -> uses(Dependency) -> Other Class
Model -> Fetch(Dependency) -> DB

Injecting Dependencies: 
* Dependency is pushed into the class from outside
* Should not intantiate dependencies using new operator inside of class instead use constructor

Dependency Inversion Principle(Lead Soft Dependency)
Class -> Interface -> Dependency
   (Dependency)  (Impliments)
